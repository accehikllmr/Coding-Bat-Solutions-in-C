# Coding-Bat-Solutions-in-C
Developed C-based solutions for the full set of algorithmic challenges in CodingBat’s “Recursion-1” (completed) and “Recursion-2” (in progress) modules.

For many solutions, the data types for the function return values and paramters were changed to facilitate implementation in C (e.g. void functions, pointer paramters, etc.)
